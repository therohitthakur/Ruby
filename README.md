# Soft Delete Functionality for Ruby on Rails Model - Item

## Introduction

This repository contains the implementation of a basic soft delete functionality for a Ruby on Rails model named `Item`. Soft deletes involve marking records as "deleted" without physically removing them from the database. This is commonly used to implement features such as a trash/recycle bin.

## Model Creation

The `Item` model has been created with the following attributes:

- `name` (string)
- `deleted_at` (datetime)

## Soft Delete Implementation

The `Item` model includes two methods for soft delete:

1. `soft_delete`: Marks an item as deleted by updating the `deleted_at` attribute with the current timestamp.
2. `restore`: Restores a soft-deleted item by setting the `deleted_at` attribute to `nil`.

## Default Scope

A default scope has been added to the `Item` model to exclude "deleted" items from normal queries. This ensures that soft-deleted items are not included in regular database queries.

```ruby
class Item < ApplicationRecord
  default_scope { where(deleted_at: nil) }
end
